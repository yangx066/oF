# Week2 homework
My project is inspired by Pablo Picasso's oil paints. I used very simple lines and shapes describe a story. 
It is the story about Bill Cunningham, a fashion photography who always shoot fashion photos on his bike in Manhattan.
In this drawing, it includes a big circle which represent the lense of camera and 2 smaller circle represent the bike.
I used if statement and for loop to create the repeated lines. The lines in the background represent the city, and when
you click on your mouse, the lines in back ground will become white, which looks like the flashlight is working.
